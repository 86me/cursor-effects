      These days with our busy lives, jobs, phones, emails, tweets, and all that
      jazz. <b>My lord, when does it end!</b>

      <br /><br />I'd like to take the web back a little bit, into the wonderful
      days where knowing how to get your little mouse arrow to
      <span>dance</span> and <span>sway</span> were the most of your worries.

      <br /><br />Each of the cursor effects below are built for your modern
      browser (fast, efficient, mobile friendly), and are super easy to add to
      your site! <b><i>Try them out below.</i></b>
